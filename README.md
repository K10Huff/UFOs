# Overview of the Analysis
The goal this project was to provide an interactive and dynamic website, using JavaScript and HTML, that allowed users to filter a dataset of UFO sightings to search by date, city, state, country, and shape.

# Results
To perform a search, the user must enter in their search criteria into the forms on the left side of the website and press enter after each criterion has been entered. Their options include searching by date, city, state, country, or shape. If the user would like to reset the page the need to click on the "UFO Sightings" button up on the Navigation bar at the top of the web page. <br>

# Summary
One drawback of this website is that it does not provide the user with what their search options are, so a drop-down menu might be of some assistance. Another feature that could be useful would be a "Search" button the user could click to make it more apparent how to start the search query. Lastly, the website does not provide any summary statics regarding the number of sightings by date, city, state, country, or shape. Further development of this site could include providing the user with such summaries and including a drop-down menu and the Search button. An additional development could be mapping the sightings onto an interactive map.
